title: Effective number of hypothesis
---


In this time, we will talk about how to reduce the number of hypothesis, M which we discussed in lecture 2. (링크)  The discussion will proceed in the following three parts :


1. Where did the M come from? 

2. Ilustrative examples 

3. Break point

#### 1. Where did the M come from? 

$$
\mathbb{P}\left[ \lvert E_{\text{in}} - E_{\text{out}} \rvert > \epsilon \right] \leq 2\textcolor{red}{M} e^{-2\epsilon^2 N}
$$



This is the inequality we discussed in lecture 2. At the end of the Lecture 2, i promised to make M tighter. This is the right time to do that.
