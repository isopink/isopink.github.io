title: "Lecture 14 : Support Vector Machine"
---

In this time, we are going to discuss the Support Vector Machine. The discussion will proceed in the following three parts: 

1. Maximizing the margin

2. The solution

3. Nonlinear transforms

#### 1. Maximizing the margin 

![solution](/assets/images/svm_1.svg) 

Suppose we are given linearly separable data as above figure illustrates. Which line could be the best boundary line? We can draw a line as below: 

![solution](/assets/images/svm_2.svg) 

Is it the best line? When is it going to start making an error? This is the concept of margin, highlited in yellow. Let us draw another line:

![solution](/assets/images/svm_3.svg) 

It seems better than the previous line, since it has wider margin. Let us try to get the best margin:

![solution](/assets/images/svm_4.svg) 

We finally get the widest margin. Can we say that this one is the best boundary line? $E_{\text{in}}$ are all zero, and the generalization performance will be same since we four points equally. Nonetheless, we may agree with the third one is the best choice, intuitively. Let us now consider two quenstions.

##### 1.1. Why is bigger margin better? 

Consider we are allowed to use a classifeir, but we have to have at least some margin to accept it. The situation is illustrated in the following figure. 

![solution](/assets/images/svm_5.svg) 

If the least margin should be greater than case (b), we are putting a restriction on the [growth function](https://isopink.github.io/Effective-number-of-hypothesis/). Fat margins imply fewer [dichotomies](https://isopink.github.io/Effective-number-of-hypothesis/) possible. Therefore, we have smaller [VC dimension](https://isopink.github.io/VC-Dimension/), than if we didn't restrict them. 

Although this is all informal, we will come to a result that estimates the $E_{\text{out}}$ based on the margin, at the end of this post. And we will find out that indeed, bigger margin enables better $E_{\text{out}}$. So, we now try to believe that the fat margins are good. Let us try to solve for them.
