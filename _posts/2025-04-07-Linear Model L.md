title: "Lecture 3 : The Linear Model I"
---

In this time, I am going to introduce some Linear Model. This part is not directly related to the previous or next chapters.
Nevertheless, it will be used for deeper concepts later. The discussion will proceed in the following four parts :   

1. Input representation

2. Linear Classification    

3. Linear Regression     

4. Nonlinear Transformation
