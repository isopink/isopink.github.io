---

In this time, I will introduce some Linear Model. This part is not directly related to the previous or next chapters.
Nevertheless, it may provide a path for us to explore deeper concepts later on. The discussion will proceed in the following four parts :   

1. Input representation

2. Linear Classification    

3. Linear Regression     

4. Nonlinear Transformation
