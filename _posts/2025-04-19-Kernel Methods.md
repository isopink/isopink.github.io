title: "Lecture 15 : Kernel Methods"
---

In this time, we are going to discuss the Kernel methods to deal with the nonlinear transformations. The discussion will proceed in the following two parts: 

1. Kernel Trick

2. Soft-margin SVM

#### 1. Kernel Trick 

We have discussed the nonlinear transformation with applying [SVM](https://isopink.github.io/SVM/). However, when data is transformed into a high-dimensional space ($\mathcal{Z} space), linear separation becomes easier, but the computational complexity may increases dramatically. Kernel methods will deal with it.  

Let us recall what do we have done in $\mathcal{Z}$ space.
