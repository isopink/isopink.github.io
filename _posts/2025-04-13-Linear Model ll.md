title: "Lecture 9 : The Linear Model II"
---

In this time, We will discuss the rest of [Linear Model](https://isopink.github.io/Linear-Model-L/). The discussion will proceed in the following three parts:

1. Review of Nonlinear transforms

2. Logistic Regression

3. Error measure of Logistic Regression

4. Learning algorithm of Logistic Regression

---

#### 1. Review of nonlinear transforms 

We studied nonlinear transformations in Lecture 3, but we didnâ€™t cover everything. Therefore, we would like to add a few more points about nonlinear transformations.
