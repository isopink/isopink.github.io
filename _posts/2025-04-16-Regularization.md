title: "Lecture 12 : Regularization"
---

In this time, we will introduce regularization, a kind of way to deal with [overfitting](https://isopink.github.io/Overfitting/). The discussion will proceed in following four parts: 

1. Regularization : Heuristical explanation

2. Regularization : Mathematical explanation

3. Weight decay

4. Choosing a regularizer

#### 1. Regularization : Heuristical explanation

Regularization constratins the learning algorithm to improve $E_{\text{out}}$ expecially when noise is present. Let us recall the previous example, applying very small amount of 'regularization'.
