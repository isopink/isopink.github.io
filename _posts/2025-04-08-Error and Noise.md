title: "Lecture 4 : Error and Noise"
---

In this time, we will discuss about error and noise  it will be used for deeper concepts later. The discussion will proceed in the following three parts :

1. Error measures

2. Noisy targets

#### 1. Error measures 

When can we say that our hypothesis approximates the target funtion well? In other words, what does $h \approx f$ means? 
we need to define an error measure that qunatifies how far we are from the target funtion. Let''s formalize it first:
