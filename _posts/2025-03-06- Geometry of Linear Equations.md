title: Geometry of Linear Algebra
---

In this time, I will introduce the *geometry of linear equations*. (This part changed how I view linear euqations entirely). To reduce cognitive load, let's begin with an extremely simple linear system. 

<br>

$$
\begin{aligned}
2x - y &= 1 \\
x + y &= 5
\end{aligned}
$$

<br>

We can look at this system *by rows* and *by columns* We will check both of them.
