In this time, we will discuss the RBF. Through this, we will learn how to solve problems using unsupervised learning for data without labels. The discussion will proceed in following four parts: 

1. RBF and nearest neighbors

2. RBF and neural networks

3. RBF and kernel methods

4. RBF and regularization
