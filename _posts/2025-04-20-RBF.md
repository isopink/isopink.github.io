In this time, we will discuss the RBF. Through this, we will learn how to solve problems using unsupervised learning for data without labels. The discussion will proceed in following four parts: 

1. RBF and nearest neighbors

2. RBF and neural networks

3. RBF and kernel methods

4. RBF and regularization

#### 1. Basic RBF model

The basic idea of Radial Basis Function is that every point in the dataset affects the hypothesis. But, this is obvious since we build the hypothesis from the data. However, RBF receives influence in a special way through distance. In other words, one point in the dataset affects other nearby points more than the ones farther away. We can formalize it as below: 

<br>

<div align="center">
Each $(\mathbf{x}_n, y_n) \in \mathcal{D}$ influences $h(\mathbf{x})$ based on $\|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_n\|$
</div>

<br>

Now, let us llo at a figure below:

The center of this bump is $x_n$. This shows how the influence of $x_n$ on the neigoring points in the space. So, it is most influential nearby. Since it is affected by only distance, bump looks symmetric around. Now, let us introudce the standarad form of RBF model as below: 

<br>

$$
h(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{n=1}^{N} w_n \exp\left( -\gamma \|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_n\|^2 \right)
$$

<br>

Now we get an influence from every point in the data set. Now, let us describe why it is called raidal, basis funtion. It is radial because of this: 

<br>

$$
\underbrace{\|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_n\|}_{\text{radial}}
$$

<br>

And it is basis function because of this: 

<br>

$$
\underbrace{\exp\left( -\gamma \|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_n\|^2 \right)}_{\text{basis function}}
$$

<br>

This is our building block. We could used another basis function. So we could have another shape, that is also symmetric in center, and has the influence in a different way. And we will see an example later on. But this is basically the model in its simplest form, and its most popular form. Now we have the model.
