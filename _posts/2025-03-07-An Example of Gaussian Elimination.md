In this time, I will introduce the Gaussian Elimination. The discussion will proceed in the following four parts :   

1. Step - by - Step Example of Gaussian Elimination.    

2. Matrix Form of Elimination.    

3. Breakdwon of Elimination.     

4. Cost of Elimination.

#### 1. Step - by - Step Example of Gaussian Elimination

The simplest way to understand the Gaussian Elimination is by example. Let's begin in three demensions: 

<br>

$$
\begin{aligned}
2u &+ v&+ w  &= 5 \\
4u &- 6v&+ 0w &= -2 \\
-2u &+ 7v&+ 2w &= 9
\end{aligned}
$$

We want to find the unknown values of $u$, $v$, and $w$. We are using **Gaussian Elimination**. *It starts by subtracting muliples of the first equation from the other equations.* The goal is to eliminate $u$ from the last two equations. This requires : 

<br>

<center>
  
(a) subtract $2$ times the first equation from the second   
(b) subtract $âˆ’1$ times the first equation from the third.
