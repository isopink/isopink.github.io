In this time, We will take our first look at neural network. The discussion will proceed in the following two parts: 

1. Neural Network model

2. Backpropagation algorithm.

#### 1. Neural Network model

Neural network is made up of many perceptrons, just like a biological neural network is composed of many neurons. We begin with the basic properties of neural networks, and how to train them on data.
