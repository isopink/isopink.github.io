title: "Lecture 10 : Neural Network"
---

In this time, we will revisit and elaborate on some aspects of gradient descent discussed in the [previous time](https://isopink.github.io/Linear-Model-ll/). We will also take our first look at neural network. The discussion will proceed in the following three parts: 

1. Stochastic gradient descent

2. Neural network model

3. Backpropagation algorithm.
