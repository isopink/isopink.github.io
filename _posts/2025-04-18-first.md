title: Introduction to Linear algebra 
---


In the first Chpater, i will  introduce the central problem of Linear algebra : *Solving linear eqautions.* 
Let's start with simplest way. we have $n$ equations in $n$ unknows, where $n = 2$ : 

$$
\begin{aligned}
\textbf{Two equations} \quad & 1x + 2y = 3 \\
\textbf{Two unknowns} \quad & 4x + 5y = 6.
\end{aligned}
$$

There are two ways of finding $x$ and $y$ : *Elimination and Determinants.* 

**1. Elimination.** Subtract 4 times the first euation from the second equation. It leaves one eqaution for $y$:


$$
\textbf{(equation 2)} - 4\textbf{(equation 1)} \quad \text{gives} \quad -3y = -6
$$

Immediately we know $y=2$. Then $x$ comes from the first equation $1x + 2y = 3$:


$$
\textbf{Back-substitution} \quad 1x + 2(2) = 3 \quad \text{gives} \quad x = -1.
$$


This process is essentially no different from *Gaussian Elimination*, which will be introudced soon.  

**2. Determinants.** The solution $y=2$ and $x=-1$ depends completely on those six coefficients in the equations. There must be a formula for $x$ and $y$. It is a "ratio of determinants" (or *Cramer's rule*). It could seem a little mysterious, unless you already know about 2 by 2 determinants. I will explain it later!

$$
x = 
\frac{
\left|
\begin{array}{cc}
3 & 2 \\
6 & 5 \\
\end{array}
\right|
}{
\left|
\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 2 \\
4 & 5 \\
\end{array}
\right|
}
= \frac{3 \cdot 5 - 2 \cdot 6}{1 \cdot 5 - 2 \cdot 4}
= \frac{3}{-3} = -1.
$$ 

$$
y = 
\frac{
\left| 
\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 3 \\
4 & 6 \\
\end{array}
\right|
}{
\left| 
\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 2 \\
4 & 5 \\
\end{array}
\right|
}
= \frac{1 \cdot 6 - 3 \cdot 4}{1 \cdot 5 - 2 \cdot 4}
= \frac{-6}{-3} = 2.
$$

These two approaches provide exact same result. However, if $n$ is sufficiently large, solving linear systems by *Cramer's rule* becomes a computational Challenge. Instead, it is better to use *Gaussian Elimination.* This is the algorithm that is constantly used to slove large systems of equations. it will become the basis for half of Linear algebra. During the first Chapter, i want to explain four deeper aspects : 

1. matrix notations. 

2. Linear eqautions lead to geomerty of planes. 

3. singular case. 

4. rough count of the number of elimination steps. 

Now let's begin.
