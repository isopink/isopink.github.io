title: Introduction to Linear algebra 
---


In the first Chpater, i will  introduce the central problem of Linear algebra : *Solving linear eqautions.* 
Let's start with simplest way. we have $n$ equations in $n$ unknows, where $n = 2$ : 

$$
\begin{aligned}
\textbf{Two equations} \quad & 1x + 2y = 3 \\
\textbf{Two unknowns} \quad & 4x + 5y = 6.
\end{aligned}
$$

There are two ways of finding $x$ and $y$ : *Elimination and Determinants.* 

**1. Elimination.** Subtract 4 times the first euation from the second equation. It leaves one eqaution for $y$:


$$
\textbf{(equation 2)} - 4\textbf{(equation 1)} \quad \Rightarrow \quad -3y = -6
$$

Immediately we know $y=2$. Then $x$ comes from the first equation $1x + 2y = 3$:


$$
\textbf{Back-substitution} \quad 1x + 2(2) = 3 \quad \text{gives} \quad x = -1.
$$


This process is essentially no different from *Gaussian Elimination*, which will be introudced soon.  

**2. Determinants.** The solution $y=2$ depends completely on those six coefficients in the equations. There must be a formula for $y$. It is a "ratio of determinants" (or *Cramer's rule*). It could seem a little mysterious, unless you already know about 2 by 2 determinants. I will explain at Chapter 4!

$$
y = 
\left| 
\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 3 \\
4 & 6 \\
\end{array}
\right|
\Bigg/
\left| 
\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 2 \\
4 & 5 \\
\end{array}
\right|
= \frac{1 \cdot 6 - 3 \cdot 4}{1 \cdot 5 - 2 \cdot 4} 
= \frac{-6}{-3} = 2.
$$

Let's compare those two approaches. 
When n is sufficiently large, solving linear equation by Cramer's rule becomes a computational Challenge. (However, it will provide an exact solution!) 

Instead, We use Gaussian Elimination. This is the algorithm that is constantly used to slove large systems of equations. it will become the basis for half of linear algebra! 


During the first Chapter, i want to explain four deeper aspects : 

1. matrix notations. 

2. Linear eqautions lead to geomerty of planes. 

3. singular case. 

4. rough count of the number of elimination steps. 
 
Now let's begin.
