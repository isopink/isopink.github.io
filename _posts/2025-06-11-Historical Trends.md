In this post, I introduce the brief history of Deep Learning. The discussion will proceed in the following two parts: 

1. Three Waves of Deep Learning

2. Why Deep Learning Became Successful

#### 1. Three Waves of Deep Learning

Deep learning might seem new, but it actually started in the 1940s. Over time, it had different names—like cybernetics, connectionism, and now deep learning. By looking at this history, we can understand how it became such a powerful tool in AI.

##### 1.1. Cybernetics (1940s–1960s)

In the beginning, researchers were inspired by how the brain works. They made simple models like the McCulloch-Pitts neuron and the perceptron. These early models could solve simple tasks and introduced ideas like learning by changing weights. This laid the foundation for later training methods. Following fiugure shows how the names for these ideas changed over time.

##### 1.2. Connectionism (1980s–1990s)

In the 1980s, a new wave called connectionism became popular. It focused on using many simple units together and training them with a method called backpropagation. These models were more powerful, but they still had limits and eventually lost popularity. Following figure shows how artificial networks became more connected, closer to real brains.

##### 1.3. Deep Learning (2006–Now)

The third wave started in 2006. Thanks to better computers and more data, deep learning models became easier to train. These models started doing better than old methods at tasks like image and speech recognition.

##### 2.1. More Data

As the world became more digital, we got much more data. From small datasets like MNIST to big ones like ImageNet, deep learning models could now learn better patterns. Following figure shows how much bigger datasets have gotten over time.

##### 2.2. More Compute

Better hardware like GPUs and faster networks helped train larger models. Some deep networks now have millions or even billions of weights. Following figure shows how these models have grown and how they compare to real animals.

##### 2.3. Better Results and More Use Cases

Deep learning can now recognize complex images, understand language, and help with things like translation and drug discovery. Following figure shows how image recognition has improved a lot thanks to deep learning.
